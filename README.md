# Hangman
A little sample program with an oldie but goldie game of Hangman.

Can be played in a console. 6 tries per round. The game allows to play with a partner (the word entry is hidden since the program uses the password function) or
you can play the game against the computer.

The computer uses a copy of the en_US Hunspell Dictionary
Version 2020.12.07

So be prepared for a tough match!

Have fun with this!
